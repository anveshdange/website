Greetings ðŸ‘‹, my name is Anvesh Dange! I am an AI enthusiast (primarily deep generative modeling, multimodal models, Transformer, Neural Networks), tinker with Linux,
and explore anything else I fancy. I happen to be a Junior Student 
doing Bachelors in Artificial Intelligence.

Outside of the computer-sphere, I enjoy productively procrastinating by watching
Anime & yt videos. I also have an interest in (slowly) learning games 
like chess.

I'm using this site to document and consolidate my learning and to highlight
any interesting projects I'm working on. If you notice any mistakes or just
want to chat feel free to reach out!
