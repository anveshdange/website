There are many things which are supposed to be done to create a website like learning HTML, CSS, Javascript.\nMy Journey of creating a portfolio website started somewhere in the year 2021 when I was in my 12th Grade. I was very fond of computers from a very early stage. I loved to tinker and figure out how things would work. Youtube was my best teacher then \u0026 still is. As a novice there were not many option for me to learn about computers. At that time , I knew Python Programming and some HTML, CSS. Hence, I chose to learn Web Development. I started watching youtube videos on web development.\nSince, I had no guidance or a straight roadmap, I learned React.js before learning Javascript or even CSS completely. It was then I realised that I should not leave my basics. I started to learn CSS and Javascript first.\nIn the second half of 2021, I programmed my first ever portfolio website in Pure HTML and vanilla Javascript. It was a big deal for a student in this high school to have a portfolio website. But I was motivated by the curiosity of the technology rather getting job in web dev.\nImages of Historic Portfolio The Website was a One Page Website. Here are some glimses. Hero Page of my Historic Portfolio\n‚ÄúAbout me‚Äù page of my portfolio\nThis website was hosted for free on Google Drive and a free service called drive to web which can host any static website present on one‚Äôs Google Drive. Here is the code for the website.\nNeed for New ? I have grown since I built my Portfolio. I‚Äôve been reading many blogs from other developers who are doing great work in their fields. There are many reasons that made me convinced for a blog style portfolio.\nBlogs will help me document my entire journey from here on. There have been times when I was lost in learning new stuff that I forgot how far I‚Äôve come. Documenting would help me track that distance.\nKeeping a blog is a good way to write tutorials or projects documentation and will help me in the future for writing a thesis or any technical/scientific document.\nI am a person who procastinates a lot. I want to change this habit and be motivated to learn. I believe writing a blog will help me keep myself motivated when a hard topic strikes. Watching myself conquer topics and document it will help for sure.\nExpectations To be honest, I don‚Äôt know if I would be capable to post quite often. I will try to write blogs and tutorials of the things I would be learning in the future in the field of AI.\nThis is my first blog so went a little longer than expected. But keeping in mind the tight schedule a college going student like me has, I will keep tutorials short. (or maybe increase my typing speed üòâ)\nThat‚Äôs it for now. See you in the tutorials !!\n",
